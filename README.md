## Overview

**Home**, your safe place now accessible anywhere, anytime. Conceptualized from the iPhone widget screen in which the consumer would be able to view what they deem relevant. Home.io takes that feature out of your physical phone and brings it online so that at any moment in time, you'll be able to update yourself on the weather, local news, or even an inspirational quote to keep your day going. No matter where you are, you are always *welcome Home.*

## MVP


**Back-End**
- Build server with Ruby on Rails, exposing RESTful JSON endpoints
- Use Rails to define models for interacting with the database, through PostgreSQL
- Should be fully capable of CRUD
- Minimum of 3 tables in database
- Minimum of 1 relationship between tables
- Capable of User Authentication 

**Front-End**
- Must be built using React
  - Should render 8 different components
  - State should be passed effectively as a prop throughout (to relieve time complexity on rendering components)
- Consume & render data from Ruby on Rails API
- Allow full CRUD interaction with back end server


**Styling**
- Tackled with a mobile-first approach
- Styled, animated, & responsive with strictly CSS
- Layout design structured using Flexbox & Grid

**Linting** 
- Code should read like a book
  - Proper indentation
  - Semantic variable & class names following  <code>camelCase</code>, <code>snake_case</code>, <code>kebab-case</code>, & <code>PascalCase</code> conventions.
  - Follow the DRY principle
- Remove all <code>console.log()</code>s & commented out code
- Code that works but is not refactorable in the given timeframe should be flagged & supplemented with comments explaining the flag's purpose

**Deployment**
- Front-end deployed via Surge
- Back end deployed via Heroku 

**Procedural**
- Remain Agile
    - No blocks should be explained or implemented twice
    - Project should be broken into components that are logical and maintainable to promote further refactoring or additions.
- Establish branches based on production, development, & feature testing.
- Features should be committed on completion; compartmentalizing updates while containing bugs.
